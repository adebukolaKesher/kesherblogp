    <h2>Full Course Meal</h2>


    <p class="origin">
        The first version of a full course meal--one with three courses--originated in Spain in the 9th century. A Persian polymath named Ziryab insisted to the Emirati court that meals be served in segments.
        He wanted soup, followed by a main dish, and finishing with a dessert. 
        The idea caught on and gradually became more popular throughout Spain and other parts of Europe and the Middle East.

        <p>Full Course Meal Overview
        A full course meal or multi-course dinner is a meal of multiple courses,
         which are items served together. Each has a particular size and meaning that justifies its sequence.
        </p>
        
        <p>Most restaurants offer a three-course meal with an appetizer, an entrée, and dessert. It's possible to add more courses, such as a fourth course that includes soup or hors-d'oeuvres before the appetizer.
        Determining whether you're having a full course meal can help you calculate the amount of time your dinner will take. It will also give you an idea of how much it will cost. You might also allow time for yourself to get hungry before the meal.

       <h3>Full Course Meals In The United States</h3>
        
     <p>  The dinner starts with an appetizer or hors-d'oeuvre, a small serving that doesn't include red meat.
        A variety of dishes might follow, usually something light or a fish.
        Next is the <code>main </code>course, the largest and most important course of the meal.
        The meal continues with a selection of cheese accompanied by wine. However, in the United Kingdom, the cheese course will follow dessert as the final course of the dinner.
        Finally, diners choose a type of <code>dessert</code> to finish their meal. It can be either hot or cold and accompanied by an appropriate dessert wine.
        </p>
        <h4>Full Course Meal Table Setting</h4>
       <p> In this layout, diners can find the correct implement for the<code> first </code>course at the outer edge of the fancy arrangement.
        A thirteen-course place setting includes numerous utensils, receptacles, and vessels.
         Near the plate on both sides, you'll find:
        <li> a caviar spoon</li>
<li>a cocktail fork</li>
<li>an escargot fork</li>
<li>a bouillon spoon</li>
<li>a fish fork and knife</li>
<li>a lobster pick</li>
<li>a bone marrow spoon</li>
<li>an entrée fork and knife</li>
<li>a relevé fork and knife</li>
<li>a saladé fork and knife</li>
Above the plate, there's a bread knife and a plate with a personal butter dish. There's also a fishbone dish, sorbet spoon, cheese knife, nut pick, and a dessert fork and spoon.
On the right side of the plate, you'll find a salt cellar and spoon with pepper. Glassware includes a water goblet, champagne flute, white wine, red wine, dessert or sherry, and port glasses.
       </p>
This layout is usual for<code> dinners </code>served à la carte,so the appropriate silverware is available for each course.
 For example, some diners may order thick, creamy soups while others order thin, clear soups.</p>
 <p>Each of these soups requires a specific spoon. It would be impractical to place a useless spoon on the table.
