A full course meal is a dinner consisting of multiple dishes or courses. 
The most common example includes three courses: an appetizer, a light dinner, 
and a selection from the dessert menu.
t's possible to add more courses to a full course meal and include additional items. 
These meals are often extravagant events and celebrate a person or a special occasion.
Origin
The first version of a full course meal--one with three courses--originated in Spain in the 9th century. A Persian polymath named Ziryab insisted to the Emirati court that meals be served in segments.

He wanted soup, followed by a main dish, and finishing with a dessert. 
The idea caught on and gradually became more popular throughout Spain and other parts of Europe and the Middle East.

Full Course Meal Overview
A full course meal or multi-course dinner is a meal of multiple courses, which are items served together. Each has a particular size and meaning that justifies its sequence.

Most restaurants offer a three-course meal with an appetizer, an entr√©e, and dessert. It's possible to add more courses, such as a fourth course that includes soup or hors-d'oeuvres before the appetizer.

Determining whether you're having a full course meal can help you calculate the amount of time your dinner will take. It will also give you an idea of how much it will cost. You might also allow time for yourself to get hungry before the meal.

The following is the typical sequence for full course meals in the United States:

The dinner starts with an appetizer or hors-d'oeuvre, a small serving that doesn't include red meat.
A variety of dishes might follow, usually something light or a fish.
Next is the main course, the largest and most important course of the meal.
The meal continues with a selection of cheese accompanied by wine. However, in the United Kingdom, the cheese course will follow dessert as the final course of the dinner.
Finally, diners choose a type of dessert to finish their meal. It can be either hot or cold and accompanied by an appropriate dessert wine.
